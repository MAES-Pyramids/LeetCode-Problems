# Problem-Solving Repo
This repository is dedicated to problem-solving using the LeetCode roadmap as a guide.
The roadmap provides a structured approach to improving your problem-solving skills and understanding different algorithms and data structures.
The repository is designed for us to collaborate and solve problems on various topics and techniques including
- arrays & hashing,
- two pointers.
- binary search,
- linked lists,
- sliding window,
- stack,
- tree

so on .........................

## Roadmap
We will follow the LeetCode roadmap available at [neetcode.io/roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap). The roadmap provides a clear path to progress through various problem-solving topics and gradually build your skills.
